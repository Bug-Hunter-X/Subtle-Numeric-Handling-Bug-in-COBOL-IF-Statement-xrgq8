This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a COBOL program involving numeric comparisons within an `IF` statement.  The bug is tricky to identify because it doesn't result in an immediate compiler error or obvious runtime crash. The solution highlights best practices for handling numeric data and conditional logic in COBOL to prevent such issues.
